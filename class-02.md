# summary of HTML, CSS & JS
## HTML Text :
Headings and paragraphs
Bold, italic, emphasis
Structural and semantic markup
To implement such semantic mark up, HTML provides dedicated tags that you can use to represent such sections, for example:

* header: < header>.
* navigation bar: < nav>.
* main content: < main>, with various content subsections represented by < article>,
* < section> 
* < div> elements.
* sidebar: < aside>; often placed  inside
* < main>.
* footer: < footer>.
 
 
 # Chapter 2 (html book)
In this chapter the concept of editing the visual content (specifically text) is further explained
* H 1-6 tags are used to highlight important headers on the rendered page
* if you want to directly mark something as bold or italic you can use the b and i tags respectively
* There are tags that provide the superscript and the subscript syntax
* Spaces and even breaks are always recognized for a single space by the browsers, so in order to over come that if required a br/ tag or a hr/ tag is used at the point a new line is required
* the stong tag does the same editing funtions as the bold

# Chapter 10 
## Introducing CSS
CSS allows you to create rules to dictate how elements should appear. These rules contain two parts: selector and declaration. CSS treats each element as if it appears inside it’s own box

# CSS selectors:

* Universal selector - *{}
* Type selector - p{}
* Class selector - .class{}
* ID selector - #id{}
* child selector - li>a{} (selects  direct children elements of the parent)
* Descendant selector - p a{} (selects children elements within the parent element)
* Adjacent Sibling selector - h1 +p{} (selects first sibling directly next to the h1 element) General Sibling selector - h1 ~ p{} (selects all elements that are siblings of the parent element)



# JavaScript

# Decisions and Loops

### DECISIONS :

Using the results of evaluations, you can decide which path your script should go down.

### LOOPS :

There are also many occasions where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly

## Different Kinds of Loops

* for - loops through a block of code a number of times
* for/in - loops through the properties of an object
* for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
* while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
* do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
