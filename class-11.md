* The HTML img tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

* Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

* The img tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

* The img tag has two required attributes:

 * src - Specifies the path to the image
 * alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
