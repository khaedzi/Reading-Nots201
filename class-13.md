# what is the local storage ?
localStorage is a way to store data on the client’s computer. It allows the saving of key/value pairs in a web browser and it stores data with no expiration date. localStorage can only be accessed via JavaScript, and HTML5. However, the user has the ability to clear the browser data/cache to erase all localStorage data.

# HTML 5 Storage :
HTML5 Storage” is a specification named Web Storage , which was part of the HTML5 specification proper, but was split out into its own specification . browser vendors refer to it as “Local Storage” or “DOM Storage.”

Html5 is a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab or exit your browser. This data is never transmitted to the remote web server or you can send it manually. Unlike all previous attempts at providing persistent local storage, it is implemented natively in web browsers, so it is available even when third-party browser plugins are not.


 (Links to an external site.)There are two types of data storage objects:
localStorage: Stores data with no specified expiration date.
sessionStorage: Stores data for a single session.(when the client click close for the browser the storage will clear)
# in the past :
In the beginning, there was only Internet Explorer. Or at least, that’s what Microsoft wanted the world to think. To that end, as part of the First Great Browser Wars, Microsoft invented a great many things and included them in their browser-to-end-all-browser-wars, Internet Explorer. One of these things was called DHTML Behaviors, and one of these behaviors was called userData.
# develpoed : 
In 2007, Google launched Gears, an open source browser plugin aimed at providing additional capabilities in browsers. Gears provides an API to an embedded SQL database based on SQLite. After obtaining permission from the user once, Gears can store unlimited amounts of data per domain in SQL database tables.
